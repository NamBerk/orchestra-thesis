rnc.c implements all the functions to perform Random Linear Network
Coding based broadcast. Within this file the RLNC is initialized for 
all nodes in the network. The nodes in the network could identify 
themselves either as sink, intermediate or destination node. This 
identification happens due to the node's ID. Furthermore, broadcast connection 
is initialized and it is ensured that the transmission to be from sink node to 
destination nodes through intermediate nodes. Upon the reception of the packets
 the callback function "receiver" is called. Here the packet is parsed in order
to determine how to process the incoming packet. In rnc.h the structure of a 
RNC-packet is defined as struct rnc_pkt. As mentioned the direction of the 
broadcast is from sink node to destination nodes.  In the function the sink 
initiates the  broadcast by sending out the first batch. Dependent on which 
value was set for NUMBER_OF_BATCHES in params.h the source will repeat sending 
batches in a INTERVAL_BATCH seconds interval. In turn, each packet in a batch
is sent out after INTERVAL_PKT seconds. The packets sent by the sink
are uncoded which means that all coefficients are 0x00 except one
which is 0x01. Data is processed for all non-sink nodes. Even though that's the
case only the destination nodes could decode the encoded packets by the intermediate 
nodes. Destination nodes use Gaussian Elimination in order to decode the packet.
